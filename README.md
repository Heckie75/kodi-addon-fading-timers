Powerful timers for KODI

I wanted to have a Kodi addon that is a sleep timer, a doze timer, has several other timer slots and combines it with fading volume in and out over a certain period. Since I haven't found it I decided to program it by myself. 

The result is a powerful timer addon.  

## Overview of features:
* 10 timer slots. All of them can be quickly set up by using context menu
* 2 additional slots for sleep and doze timers with single-click-setup 
* Timers can play any ressource that it available in Kodi, e.g. music, video files, TV/radio programs, ressources from 3rd party plugins, e.g. Zattoo channels. 
* Timers can be set from TV / Radio EPG
* Different schedule modes: once, everyday, Mon-Fri, Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun, Sun-Thu, Mon-Thu, specific weekday and many more
* Date change is supported, e.g. from 23:30 (p.m.) until 1:30 (a.m.) 
* Two end modes, i.e. duration or specific time
* Actions related to media: start media and stop at end, just start media, start media at end, stop media immediately, stop media at end, powerdown system
* Linear fading in timer period: fade-in, fade-out, no fading. Min and max volume can be set for each timer
* Custom label for timer
* After KODI startup timers, that are in period, start retroactivly altought KODI was not running at start time. Fading volume is calculated correctly.
* MS Windows only: Feature in order to prevent that Windows displays lock screen if Kodi idles
