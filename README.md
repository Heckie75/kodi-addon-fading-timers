Powerful timers for KODI


I wanted to have a Kodi addon that is a sleep timer, a doze timer, has several other timer slots and combines it with fading volume in and out over a certain period. Since I haven't found it I decided to program it by myself. 

The result is a powerful timer addon.  

## Overview of features:
* 10 timer slots. 5 of it can be quickly set up by using context menu
* 2 additional slots for sleep and doze timers with 5-clicks-setup 
* Timers can play any ressource that it available in Kodi, e.g. music, video files, TV/radio programs, ressources from 3rd party plugins, e.g. Zattoo channels. 
* Different schedule modes: once, everyday, Mon-Fri, Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun, Sun-Thu, Mon-Thu, specific weekday
* Date change is supported, e.g. from 23:30 (p.m.) until 1:30 (a.m.) 
* Two end modes, i.e. duration or specific time
* Actions related to media: Play at start and stop at end, just play at start, stop immediately at start, just stop at end, do nothing with media
* Linear fading in timer period: fade-in, fade-out, no fading. Min and max volume can be set for each timer
* Custom label for timer

## Install kodi plugin / addon
First of all download the plugin archive file, i.e. [script.service.heckies.timer.tgz](/script.service.heckies.timer.tgz)

You must extract this archive in the Kodi plugin folder
```
# change to kodi's addon directory
$ cd ~/.kodi/addons/

# extract plugin
$ tar xzf ~/Downloads/script.service.heckies.timer.tgz 
```

After you have restarted Kodi you must activate the plugin explicitly. 
1. Start Kodi
2. Go to "Addons" menu
3. Select "User addons"
4. Select "Service" addons, select "Heckies timers" and activate it
